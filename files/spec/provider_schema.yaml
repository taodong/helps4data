      ## Random Text String Provider
      ## category name: text
      ## locale supported: en-US
      ## Usage:
      ## 1. Word Count:
      ## The word count of generated text is defined through "size" constraint or "length" constraint
      ## The word count does not include any prefixes and suffixes provided
      ## If no count is provided, the provider generates a random word count between 5 and 20
      ## 1.1 Word Count
      ## Fixed word count is defined through "length" constraint
      ## Example of generate 5 words:
      ## constraints:
      ##   - type: "length"
      ##     max: 5
      ## 1.2 Format
      ## Extra format can be defined through "format" constraint
      ## It's important to have pipe (|) character at the beginning of the format string because format spec is passed as YAML string in a separate process
      ## In a format spec, you can define three extra properties:
      ##  - prefixes: list of prefixes to be added to the generated text
      ##  - suffixes: list of suffixes to be added to the generated text
      ##  - style: style of the generated text
      ##    - 1: all lower case, e.g. "hello world"
      ##    - 2: all upper case, e.g. "HELLO WORLD"
      ##    - 3: upper case for first character, lower case for others, e.g. "Hello world"
      ##    - 4: camel case for each word, e.g. "Hello World"
