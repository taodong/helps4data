# Miscellaneous

## Null Value
In order to handle `null` value properly cross different data formats, please use the special string `<?null?>` when setting a `null` value in our configuration.

```yaml title="Sample Null Value Usage"
# Apply about 70% of the "desc" property in the "product" entity to be null
    - entity: "product"
      count: 5
      properties:
        - name: "desc"
          values:
            - values:
                - "<?null?>"
              weight: 0.7
```

## Current Datetime
To set a property to the current datetime, please use the special string `<?now?>` in your configuration.

```yaml title="Sample Current Datetime Usage"
# Set the "createdAt" property in the "orders" entity to the current datetime
    - entity: "orders"
      count: 10
      properties:
        - name: "createdAt"
          defaultValue: "<?now?>"
```
