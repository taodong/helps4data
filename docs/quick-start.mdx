# Quick Start
Each data generation order takes up to three input files in YAML format:
1. **Schema File**: [required] It defines the structure of the data to be generated.
2. **Plan File**: [required] It defines target data details, such as record number.
3. **Output Control File**: [optional] It defines any modifications for data presentation.

For example, we can use this **[schema file](./assets/quick-start/schema.yaml)** and **[plan file](./assets/quick-start/plan.yaml)** to generate data, structured as illustrated below
![post sample](/img/samples/quick_start.png)
Based on the chosen output format type, each entity defined in the schema file will be generated as a separate file.
For example, if the output format is set to JSON, as illustrated, three files will be generated:
![json output file](/img/samples/output_file_type.png)
- users_0.json
- follows_1.json
- posts_2.json

The number trailing the entity name identifies the order in which the data should be applied to the target system, such as MySQL.
## Schema File
The schema file is a YAML file that defines the structure of the data to be generated. It contains the following fields, both of which are required:
1. **name** - The name of the schema, which serves as an ID to pair with the plan file.
2. **entities** - A set of entity definitions. At least one entity is required. Entities with the same name are considered duplicates, and this will cause the data generation to fail.

An **entity** is the fundamental unit of data generation. The data for each entity will be stored in a distinct output file. An entity consists of a list of properties, each of which includes the following mandatory fields:
1. **name** - This represents the name of the property.
2. **type** - This denotes the data type of the property.

```yaml title="Sample schema comprise 'users' entity with single 'id' property"
name: "quickstart"
entities:
  - name: "users"
    properties:
      - name: "id"
        type: "sequence"
```
### Property Data Type
When defining a property under entity, the following data types are supported.

| Type     | Description                                                   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| sequence | An auto incremental integer number                            |
| text     | A text value                                                  |
| number   | A decimal number value, such as 100, -54 or 99.99             |
| date     | A date value with day-level accuracy                          |
| datetime | A date time value with second level accuracy                  |
| time     | A time value without date with second level accuracy          |
