# Quick Start
Each data generation order takes up to three input files in YAML format:
1. **Schema File**: [required] It defines the structure of the data to be generated.
2. **Plan File**: [required] It defines target data details, such as record number.
3. **Output Control File**: [optional] It defines any modifications for data presentation.

For example, we can use this **[schema file](./assets/quick-start/schema.yaml)** and **[plan file](./assets/quick-start/plan.yaml)** to generate data, structured as illustrated below
![post sample](/img/samples/quick_start.png)
Based on the chosen output format type, each entity defined in the schema file will be generated as a separate file.
For example, if the output format is set to JSON, as illustrated, three files will be generated:
![json output file](/img/samples/output_file_type.png)
- users_0.json
- follows_1.json
- posts_2.json

The number trailing the entity name identifies the order in which the data should be applied to the target system, such as MySQL.
## Schema File
The schema file is a YAML file that defines the structure of the data to be generated. It contains the following fields, both of which are required:
1. **name** - The name of the schema, which serves as an ID to pair with the plan file.
2. **entities** - A set of entity definitions. At least one entity is required. Entities with the same name are considered duplicates, and this will cause the data generation to fail.
